# Set up a new membership

> This guide assumes that you have a client with a pre-standing appointment already scheduled and on the books, potentially even completed (i.e. you're signing them up for a membership to pay for the day's treatment). If you do not, then create one for the client you'll be setting up with membership. For services, add the treatment they have received or will be receiving that day.

### Steps
- Add a "Membership Initiation" SERVICE to their appointment
- Have the client complete their forms
- Add an "Initiation Fee" PRODUCT to their bill
- Add the Membership (with appropriate tier) PRODUCT
- Ensure their primary service (i.e. PicoWay) is changed to the "for Tier #" option
- Charge a partial amount equal to their membership tier (i.e. $199.00 for Tier III members)
- Charge the remainder via card, cash, etc.

### Prompt the forms to their profile and have them filled
1. Assign a "Membership Initiation" appointment to the client
> This puts the forms into their profile to be completed on an iPad
2. Have the client sign their forms on an iPad

### Add the initiation fee (as a product)

### Add the membership itself (as a product)

### Change applicable treatments to their membership equivalent
- i.e. If a client is receive an "IPL for Face" service, change it to an "IPL for Tier III Member"

### Bill the account credit
- e.g. If a member is joining a Tier III membership, then bill $199.00 (even if they have $0.00)
> The account balance will go negative then back to 0 when the transaction completes and membership credit is applied

### Complete the transaction and pay the initiation fee plus any remaining balances
