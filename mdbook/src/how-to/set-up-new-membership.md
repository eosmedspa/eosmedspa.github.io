# Set up a new membership

> This guide assumes that you have a client with a pre-standing appointment already scheduled and on the books. If you do not, then create one for the client you'll be setting up with membership. For services, add the treatment they have received or will be receiving that day.

### Prompt the forms to their profile and have them filled
1. Assign a "Membership Initiation" appointment to the client
> This puts the forms into their profile to be completed on an iPad
2. Have the client sign their forms on an iPad

### Add the initiation fee (as a product)

### Add the membership itself (as a product)

### Change applicable treatments to their membership equivalent
- i.e. If a client is receive an "IPL for Face" service, change it to an "IPL for Tier III Member"

### Bill the account credit
- e.g. If a member is joining a Tier III membership, then bill $199.00 (even if they have $0.00)
> The account balance will go negative then back to 0 when the transaction completes and membership credit is applied

### Complete the transaction and pay the initiation fee plus any remaining balances
