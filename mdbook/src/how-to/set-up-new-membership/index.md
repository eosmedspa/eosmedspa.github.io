- Add the Membership (with appropriate tier) PRODUCT to their transaction
#### Change applicable treatments to their membership equivalent
- Ensure their primary service (i.e. PicoWay) is changed to the "for Tier #" option
- i.e. If a client is receive an "IPL for Face" service, change it to an "IPL for Tier III Member"
